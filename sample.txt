# Idea #1: Primary goal of Food Mile

The primary goal of Food Mile is to sell natural farmers’ produce at cheap prices. Farmers lose a lot of money to middlemen - food mile bridges this as a virtual middle man. Our revenue depends on Ads, not farmers. 

### Simple logic:

Customers get produce at prices set by farmers. Prices are low, and Farmers take 100% profit.

### Challenges:

Cutting out the middle man primarily means logistics have to be taken care by us. Which is not cheap, and the ad revenue generated by E-commerce customers might not be able to bridge this loss. 

### **Random Idea angle for now:**

We need the FoodMile app to be not only just any E-Commerce app for veggies and fruits (Amazon Fresh does it way better :P) but also to be everything related to food. This way, we pull more customers and more ad revenue, and our primary business stays afloat.
